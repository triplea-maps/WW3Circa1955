Communism versus Capitalism and Imperialism.  <br>     Mother Russia has called all of her nations to rise up against the evil Imperialists.  <br>     This is a battle of the U.S.S.R. (Axis) versus The United States and The United Kingdom (Allies).  <br>     These are the major powers that have risen from the ashes of World War 2.  <br>     <br>     While much of Europe has been rebuilt, it is still not up to the industrial capacity and <br>     workforce of pre-1939.  The increased dependence on oil and improved drilling technologies have <br>     caused the middle-east to become an important geo-political center on the globe.  South America <br>     has continued to build its industrial capacity and workforce but has become divided ideologically.<br>     <br>     Most of the Asian Continent is under the influence of the U.S.S.R. and is also poised to take <br>     control of the African Continent as well.  Europe and North America remain democratic nations.<br>     <br>     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>     TECHNICAL:<br>     - Based off of the Triple A Axis and Allies classic map version 1.4 and the Hasbro Axis and Allies Iron Blitz scenario Cold War.<br>     - the only neutral nation on the map is switzerland.<br>     - Teams are USSR and Japan (Dead) as Axis and the US, UK, and Germany (Dead) as ALLIES.<br>     - All active Teams have All weapons technologies.<br>     - PU values in the Middle-East and S.
